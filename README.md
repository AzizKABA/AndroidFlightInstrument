An electronic display implementation of the analog HSI instrument that can be found on the well - known cockpit instrumentation configurations such as classical T or six - pack.

Application is coded in Android Studio and needs the orientation sensor output of the smartphone. 

Circular and linear scale is used in UI where scale range is from 00 to 33 that indicates the heading angle of aircraft wrt magnetic north.

An aircraft figure is selected as the needle.

UI of the application is minimalist with black background.
